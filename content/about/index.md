Hi there, I’m **Lilay**, but you can call me Addi. I’m a sophomore studying **Computer Science** and currently self-studying **Full Stack Web Development**. I have a passion for daily driving **Linux** and all things **Open Source**.

Anyway, you'll find me hosting a few open source webapp instances for free of use. (Check out the Services section)

I enjoy a variety of music genres and sometimes like to play games. This about me page is probably sound boring to you, yes part of it are AI generated :)
